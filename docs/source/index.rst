pystencils Development Branch Documentation
===========================================

These are the documentation pages for the development branch
`backend-rework <https://i10git.cs.fau.de/pycodegen/pystencils/-/tree/backend-rework?ref_type=heads/>`_,
which hosts the rework of pystencils' code generation backend.
This is an ongoing project; as such, the documentation, too, is still under construction and bound to change rapidly.
