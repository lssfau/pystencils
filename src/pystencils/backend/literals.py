    """Representation of literal code.

    Instances of this class represent code literals inside the AST.
    These literals are not to be confused with C literals; the name 'Literal' refers to the fact that
    the code generator takes them "literally", printing them as they are.

    Each literal has to be annotated with a type, and is considered constant within the scope of a kernel.
    Instances of `PsLiteral` are immutable.

    The code generator assumes literals to be *constant* and *pure* with respect to the kernel:
    their evaluation at kernel runtime must not include any side effects.
